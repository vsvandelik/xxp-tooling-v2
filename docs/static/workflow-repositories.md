## Repository Configuration

### Configuration Structure

Repository configurations are managed within your VS Code settings. While typically handled via UI commands, their underlying structure follows this schema:

```json
{
  "name": "string",            // Repository display name
  "type": "local|remote",      // Repository type
  "path": "string",            // Local repository path (required for local type)
  "url": "string",             // Repository URL (required for remote type)
  "authToken": "string",       // Authentication token (used internally for remote access)
  "isDefault": "boolean"       // Flag indicating if this is the default repository
}
```

### Configuration Settings

#### Repository List

  * **`extremexp.workflows.repositories`** (array, default: `[]`)
  * **Purpose**: This setting stores the list of all configured workflow repositories.
  * **Management**: It is primarily managed through the VS Code commands (`ExtremeXP: Add Repository`, `ExtremeXP: Remove Repository`) rather than direct manual editing of `settings.json`.
  * **Validation**: Automatic validation ensures the configuration of each repository is correct.

#### Workflow Features Toggle

  * **`extremexp.workflows.enabled`** (boolean, default: `true`)
  * **Purpose**: Allows you to enable or disable all workflow repository features.
  * **Effect**: Controls the visibility of the "Workflow Repositories" tree view and associated commands in VS Code.
  * **Use case**: Can be disabled if workflow repository features are not needed.

#### Default Author

  * **`extremexp.workflows.defaultAuthor`** (string, default: `""`)
  * **Purpose**: Specifies a default author name that will pre-fill the author field when you upload new workflows.
  * **Convenience**: Saves time by avoiding repeated entry of your author information.

### Repository Setup

#### Local Repository Setup

To set up a local workflow repository:

1.  **Choose Directory**: Select an existing local directory or create a new one where you want to store your workflows.
2.  **Add to VS Code**: Use the `ExtremeXP: Add Repository` command. Select "Local Repository" and specify the chosen folder path.
3.  The extension will automatically set up the necessary internal structure within the specified folder.

#### Remote Repository Setup

To connect to a remote workflow repository:

1.  **Obtain URL**: Get the repository server's URL from your administrator or documentation.
2.  **Authentication**: You will provide your username and password through the VS Code UI. For internal communication, this will be securely exchanged for a token, which is transparent to the user.
3.  **Configure Connection**: Use the `ExtremeXP: Add Repository` command, select "Remote Repository," and provide the URL along with your authentication details.
4.  **Test Connection**: The extension will attempt to verify connectivity and access permissions upon configuration.

## Collaboration Features

Workflow repositories facilitate sharing and collaboration by providing a centralized location for your experimental workflows.

### Workflow Sharing

#### Upload Process

When uploading a workflow, you'll provide essential metadata:

  * **Author Information**: Your name or team's name.
  * **Description**: A clear summary of the workflow's purpose and functionality.
  * **Version Information**: A version number (e.g., 1.0.0) and optionally a description of changes.

The system performs validation before upload:

  * **Syntax Checking**: Validates XXP and ESPACE syntax.
  * **Dependency Verification**: Checks for missing imports or references within the workflow.

#### Discovery and Access

  * **Search Capabilities**: Use the search commands (`ExtremeXP: Search Workflows` or the tree view search) to find workflows by name, description, author, or keywords.
  * **Browse Interface**: The integrated web browser interface (accessible via `ExtremeXP: Open Workflow Browser`) provides enhanced Browse with categories and filters.

## Troubleshooting Repository Issues

### Connection Problems

#### Remote Repository Issues

  * **Symptoms**: You cannot connect to a remote repository, or operations fail with network errors.
  * **Solutions**:
      * Verify the repository URL is correct and your network connectivity is stable.
      * Confirm that the repository server is running and accessible.
      * Check your firewall or proxy settings if applicable.

#### Authentication Failures

  * **Symptoms**: You receive "Access Denied" or authentication errors when trying to access a remote repository.
  * **Solutions**:
      * Double-check your username and password.
      * Contact the repository administrator to verify your account permissions and access levels.

### Data Integrity Issues

#### Corrupted Downloads

  * **Symptoms**: Downloaded workflows or attachments are incomplete or corrupted.
  * **Solutions**:
      * Attempt to re-download the workflow/attachment.
      * Ensure network stability during the download process.

## Best Practices

### Repository Organization

#### Workflow Organization

  * **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent names for your workflows and their attachments.
  * **Category Structure**: Organize workflows into logical categories or subdirectories within your repositories for easier navigation.
  * **Documentation**: Include comprehensive descriptions for each workflow to clarify its purpose, inputs, and outputs.

#### Collaboration Guidelines

  * **Change Documentation**: Always document any modifications you make to workflows, especially before uploading updates.
  * **Testing Before Upload**: Validate and test workflows thoroughly before sharing them or uploading new versions to a shared repository.
  * **Communication**: Coordinate with team members when making significant changes to shared workflows to avoid conflicts.

### Security Considerations

#### Access Control

  * **Minimum Permissions**: Ensure users (and any automated systems) are granted only the minimum necessary access permissions to repositories.
  * **Credential Security**: Keep your authentication credentials (username/password) secure.
