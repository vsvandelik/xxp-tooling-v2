A comprehensive TypeScript monorepo providing complete tooling support for the ExtremeXP experiment system, including language support for XXP and ESPACE domain-specific languages.

## Overview

ExtremeXP Tooling is a comprehensive TypeScript monorepo that provides complete development and execution support for data-driven experiments. The tooling centers around two domain-specific languages (DSLs): **XXP** for defining experiment workflows and **ESPACE** for exploring parameter spaces and managing complex experimental scenarios.

Key features include:
- **VS Code Extension**: Full language support with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time validation
- **Artifact Generator**: Transforms human-readable DSL files into executable experiment artifacts
- **Experiment Runner**: Executes experiments with monitoring, recovery, and parallel execution capabilities
- **Language Server**: Provides intelligent editing features and cross-file dependency resolution
- **Workflow Repositories**: Manages and shares experiment workflows across teams
